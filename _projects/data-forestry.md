Data Forestry is the art and science of cultivating information.  

Work on data forestry began around 2011/2012 with the basic question: what would it be like to wander through all 250,000 artworks in the <a href="https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections" target="_blank">Harvard Art Museums collections</a>?  

Below is a list of fun and exploratory interfaces for large-ish collections. This is Data Forestry in practice.

<p>Everything that is currently on view in the museums&#039; galleries as a series of blooms. <br />
<br />
Approximately 1,800 objects represented as a point and a thread. The color of each thread is determined by the predominant color found in the object. This video shows three versions of a bloom. The first shows objects as points. The second shows objects as points and threads. The third shows objects as points and threads along with its title. Thread length is determined by the total count of page views for the object from May 2009 to March 2015.<br />
