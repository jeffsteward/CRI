Custom digital drawing tools that mimic motifs I used to render in more traditional physical mediums. The tools are made with <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>.

## Puddles

## Clouds

This animation demonstrates the interface for the cloud drawing tool. The toolset include options for adjusting the gray values of each cloud; toggling the bounding boxes on/off; animating the clouds; and hiding the UI. Bounding boxes are calculated with a rudimentary implementation of a scanline algorithm.
