- title: "What We Learned From Machines Looking at Art"
  description: "What happens when you ask machines to look at art? Ten years of research applying computer vision in an art museum can lead to some unusual discoveries. In this session, I will demonstrate a range of projects—from the game A(eye)-Spy to a story generator in which artworks fantasize about escape—that use the hallucinations, fever dreams, and false narratives of artificial intelligence to spark new ways of seeing and enliven conversations. These so-called “errors” reveal overlooked connections and unexpected interpretations, inviting a kind of dialogue between human and machine. Along the way, I’ll show how art offers a uniquely rich terrain for exploring subjectivity, ambiguity, and the creative potential of imperfect technologies. This session will examine how machine misperception can deepen human insight and offer a playful, provocative reframing of what it means to understand and experience art in a museum setting."
